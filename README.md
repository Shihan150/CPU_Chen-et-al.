A coupled carbon, phosphorus, and uranium (CPU) biogeochemical model is used to further explore the mechanisms of (de)oxygenation during a period of major glaciation (310 - 290 Ma).

The file ***Model_main_fig_plot.ipynb*** contains the code for running the inversion model and plotting the figures.

The file ***For_inv3.csv*** contains the proxy data used to inversely constrain the model.

The file ***raw_data.xlsx*** contains the raw and smoothed proxy data used for plotting the figures.

The file ***v4v5.dat*** holds the inversion results from the standard experiment.
